## Getting Started

### Workspace Set-up

- Create a new folder in local machine. This will be the root folder storing both the front-end and back-end of the project (which are maintained in separate repos).

  ```sh
  mkdir <WORKSPACE-NAME>
  ```

- Clone the front-end repository. The front-end repository is this repo.

  ```sh
  git clone <FRONT-END-REPOSITORY-LINK>
  ```

- Clone the back-end repository. To access the back-end repository, click [here](https://github.com/danielphan-dp/messanging-platform-server).

  ```sh
  git clone <BACK-END-REPOSITORY-LINK>
  ```

### Installation

- From the workspace folder, go to the front-end directory and install necessary packages.

  ```sh
  cd <FOLDER-OF-FRONT-END-REPO>
  npm install
  ```

- From the workspace folder, go to the back-end directory and install necessary packages.

  ```sh
  cd <FOLDER-OF-BACK-END-REPO>
  npm install
  ```

### Run

To test the features, it is the best to run the front-end and the back-end in two separate terminals.

- Start a new terminal window, go to the back-end folder, and run the server.

  ```sh
  cd <FOLDER-OF-BACK-END-REPO>
  npm start
  ```

- Start a new terminal window, go the to the front-end folder, and run the front-end dev server.

  ```sh
  cd <FOLDER-OF-FRONT-END-REPO>
  npm start
  ```

- The application should be available in `localhost:3000`.
